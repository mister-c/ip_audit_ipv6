          <p>This graph shows the number of remote hosts (or
          addresses) into three groups - those which have <b>only
          received</b> packets, those which have <b>only sent</b>
          packets, and those which have <b>sent and received</b>
          packets.</p>

          <p><i>Remote</i> computers are those whose IP address
          falls outside <b>LOCALRANGE</b> as specified in the
          <tt>ipaudit-web.conf</tt> configuration file.</p>

          <p>Remote hosts (addresses) which have <b>only
          received</b> packets of almost certainly the result of
          network scans <i>originating on your network</i>.</p>

          <p>A large number of remote hosts (addresses) which have
          <b>only sent</b> packets is unusual. The only case I know
          of is when the <i>Nimda</i> virus was active. Remote
          hosts infected with the virus would scan random address
          on the internet. Typically you would see only one address
          scanned from remote infected hosts. If the local scanned
          address did not respond, then the remote host would be
          counted in the <b>only sent</b> group.</p>

          <p>Most addresses <b>send and receive</b> packets, these
          are hosts involved in normal network communication.</p>

          <p>The count of remote hosts is taken every 30
          minutes.</p>
