IPAUDIT-WEB FAQ

1. Why don't get any graphics on the ipaudit home page? (Aug 23, 2000)

The problem could might lie anywhere in a long sequence of events. Here are
some things to look at.

* Are you getting any reports under the 30min traffic link? If not,
then ipaudit is probably not reading any traffic.

* Does the following file exist?
/home/ipaudit/reports/30min/graphic/ReportTraffic.log
If not, then probably the program ReportLog in the same directory may be broken.

* Does the file ReportTraffic.gif exist (or perhaps .png in place of .gif)? If
not, the problem is with the GraphTraffic file.
If it does exist, then perhaps the home page
/home/ipaudit/public_html/index.html has an incorrect link to the .gif (or
.png) file. 



2. Is it possible to run IPAUDIT with multiple eth devices in the same config
file?

Version 0.95 of ipaudit now allows multiple interfaces at once - so far I'm
only aware of it working under Linux. If you know of success on other platforms
I'd appreciate a quick note to jon.rifkin@uconn.edu. Thanks.

An alternative way to accomplish the goal is to use this ugly workaround. Run
two instances of ipaudit, one for each interface, and write the output to two
separate files. THEN, use 'total' to combine them. For example, something like

     ipaudit -ofile1.data
     ipaudit -ofile2.data
     
     cat file1.data file2.data | total 1,2,3,4,5 6,7,8,9 -  > both.data

Then use the file both.data to do your statistics. Note that if you use
ipaudit's -t option to save the times in file1.data and file2.data, you will
not be able to use 'total' to combine the time fields. Maybe in the next
version of 'total'.

Told you it was ugly.


3. When running IPAUDIT scripts (or when I try cron/cron30min) I get the following error

     /bin/date: invalid date `mer sep 27 16:59:56 CEST 2000'
     $IP_DIR/ipaudit died prematurely

      (Oct 3, 2000)

I think its a bug in 'date', it cannot read the dates that is writes out when
the date includes certain time zones, like 'CEST' or 'JAVT'.

Here's how to work around it, in the file cron/cron30min change the line

     CURDATE_DEF=`$GNUDATE`
to
     CURDATE_DEF=`$GNUDATE "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"`




4. Why can't the ipaudit cron scripts create gif files? The output of cron says

gnuplot> set term gif small size 600,150 xffffff x000000 xdddddd x880000 x008800 x000088 x666666 
                  ^ 
line 0: unknown or ambiguous terminal type; type just 'set terminal' for a list 


The problem is that your version of gnuplot does not produce gif files.  You
can convert ipaudit to use png files instead as follows.

      In the four files ~/reports/30min/graphic/Graph* change the line

     set term gif small size 600,150 xffffff x000000 xdddddd x880000 x008800 x000088 x666666
to
     set size 1.0, 0.3125
     set term png small color

      AND, in the file ~/public_html/index.html change the four lines such as

    <img src=images/ReportTraffic.gif>
to
    <img src=images/ReportTraffic.png>


      AND, in the file ~/reports/30min/graphic/runcron change the four lines such as

   TIMG=$IP_DIR/public_html/images/ReportTraffic.gif
to
   TIMG=$IP_DIR/public_html/images/ReportTraffic.png

          Thanks to Andy Z for the solution.


5. a script to regenerate all the image data from all the data would be useful.. (Nov 21, 2000)

You can regenerate the graphs by doing the following

   cd ~ipaudit/reports/30min/graphic
   ./runcron /home/ipaudit `date +%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M`

or if you prefer you can replace the `date...` portion of the second command with a hard coded date/time string such as

   ./runcron /home/ipaudit 2000-11-21-14:22




6. What had to be done to install ipaudit on a Solaris 7 workstation? (Feb 6, 2001)

  src/Makefile:
  -------------
  - Added -lnsl -lsocket for building ipaudit, ipstrings to resolve
    linking problems with pcap
    (gethostbyname,getprotobyname,getservbyname, getnetbyname).

  hash.c:
  -------
  Made a change to hash.c and added <sys/types.h> because it wouldn't
  compile did not recognize u_char.

  ipaudit.cfg:
  ------------
  Changed the interface to le0 from eth0

  cron30min:
  ----------
  Needed to remove ps hp ... because this is linux based and not
  recognized by Solaris.

7. When running ipaudit-web why am I receiving this email message?

           line 0: all points undefined!

      (Mar 12, 2001)

      The above line

   $IP_DIR/ipaudit died prematurely

This indicates that ipaudit aborted. Perhaps its execute permissions are not
correct. You can test the permissions by running the ipaudit command as the
ipaudit user,

   > ipaudit eth0

      If the you get the error

   ipaudit: socket: Operation not permitted (Do you need root?)

then the permisissions have not been set correctly. You can fix this by logging
on as root and typing

   > cd ~ipaudit/bin
   > chown root ipaudit
   > chgrp ipaudit ipaudit
   > chmod 4750 ipaudit




8. Problems running ipaudit-0.95 under Red Hat 7.1?

If you have this problem try using ipaudit version 0.92 instead until the
current version is fixed.

Thanks to Håkan Franzen for finding the problem and workaround.
